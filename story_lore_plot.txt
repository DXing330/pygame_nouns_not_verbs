        -build a new road through the town
            -road needs to go from a big city to another big city
            -no big cities have a shortest path through the village or they already have better roads
                -make a new big city
                    -some rare resource is discovered in the forest
                        -maybe a new dungeon or something
                        -maybe demonic portal
                            -this can easily tie into the kill all demons goals
                            -portal is a great source of mana crystals from all the weak demons coming out
                                -also a great danger from the occasional powerful demon coming out
                            -angel wants to destroy the portal
                            -town leader wants to keep it since it's drawing lots of people in
                                -compromise is sealing the portal a bit so that it's smaller
                                    -problem is others want to keep it large, it's more profitable that way
                                        -need to both find the materials to seal it and deal with obstacles
                    -clear a path for it, promise riches and people will come
                        -this is where the player will come in
                        -need to protect the worked and pass the time while they clear the path
                        -want to fund the operation and build the initial settlement near the resource
                            -compete/fight with the local lord over control
                                -need to get the duke/prince/king/baron/governor/whoever to acknowledge your right
